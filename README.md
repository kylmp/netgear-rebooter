Netgear Rebooter

Purpose: 

Monitor the Internet Port IP in my netgear M60 router, check if it is a local or external IP. 
If it is a local IP then the bridge mode with my ATT router has messed up, and the Netgear router needs to be restarted. 

This simple service monitors the IP every minute and will reboot the router if necessary.
